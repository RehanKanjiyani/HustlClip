"""Transcript windowing for candidate discovery.

The transcript is cut into overlapping windows so that long videos fit inside
small context windows; :mod:`autoclip.pipeline.funnel` sends each window to the
``candidate_discovery`` capability.

Overlap matters: a clip straddling a window edge would otherwise be seen only in
halves by both windows and proposed by neither. The overlap costs tokens and
buys back the clips that live on the seams.

(Before HustlClip this module also ran a single-model detect-and-rank pass. That
path is superseded by the funnel and the AI manager and was removed so there is
exactly one way clips get chosen.)
